# shai-simchon---penetration-script
the script does automatic nmap scan on our private network for vulnerabilities, check for weak password and save the results to log file.

This script was implemented as an addition to the hydra tool found at https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra and nmap tool found at https://nmap.org/download.html.
